## Diversity analyses based on metabarcoding data using R

In this directory we provide the results of some quick diversity analyses, such as rarefaction, richness, and NMDS.

We have performed the analyses on three different subsets of our data:
 - denovo OTUs
 - family level assignemts based on blast
 - family level assignments based on kraken

The Jupyter notebooks used to prepare the data for R as well as the R scripts used to produce the actual figures are contained in the respective directories.
