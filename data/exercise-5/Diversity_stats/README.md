## Diversity analyses based on metabarcoding data using R

In this directory we provide the results of some quick diversity analyses, such as rarefaction, richness, and NMDS.

We make use of the following R packages in our analyses:
 - [picante](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/picante/index.html)
 - [rich](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rich/index.html)
 - [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html)


Analyses were performed on three different subsets of our data:
 - all denovo OTUs
 - family level assignments based on blast
 - family level assignments based on kraken

The Jupyter notebooks used to prepare the data for R as well as the R scripts used to produce the actual figures are contained in the respective directories.
