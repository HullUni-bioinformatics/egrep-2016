Students doing the 'egrep-2016' course @EvoHull will find a local copy of NCBI's complete nucleotide (nt) database here.

If you are trying to do the course at home you can download the local copy of the nt database to here by running the command:
```bash
update_blastdb --decompress nt
```

The above script comes with the ncbi-blast suite of programs that you can get on an ubuntu system by simply running:
```bash
apt-get install ncbi-blast+
```
